            <h1>Target Audience:</h1>
            <p>
                The Queen Creek Chamber of Commerce serves the local community in and around the Town of Queen Creek, AZ. 
                The town has experienced rapid growth over the last decade and is currently experiencing a boom of new residents, restaurants, and small business growth. 
                Many new residents don't know what services are available and don't know what they are missing out on. 
                Many local businesses would like to have better opportunities but haven't figured out how to market to their immediate neighbors. 
                This site is designed to help both local patrons and businesses find each other and create successful relationships.
            </p>
